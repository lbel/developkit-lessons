This is the LHCb DevelopKit, a workshop/lesson series covering development in LHCb software, focused on the upgrade for Run 3.

If you have any problems or questions, you can [send an email to
`lhcb-starterkit@cern.ch`](mailto:lhcb-starterkit@cern.ch).

> ## Prerequisites
>
> You should have completed [StarterKit](https://lhcb.github.io/first-analysis-steps/), and optionally [ImpactKit](https://lhcb.github.io/second-analysis-steps/). Before starting, you should have lessons 1 and 2 completed, as they deal with setup, and take a fair amount of time. Select one that best suits your development environment; for upgrade work, you will want a complete environment.
