C++11 was the largest change ever made to C++; and due to the changed release schedule, probably will remain the largest single change. It is a well thought out, mostly backward-compatible change that can completely change the way you write code in C++. It is best thought of as almost a new language, a sort of (C++)++ language. There are too many changes to list here, and there are excellent resources available, so this is meant to just give you a taste of some of the most useful changes.

Many of the features work best together, or are related. There already are great resources for learning about C++11 (listed at the bottom of this lesson), and C++11 is already in use in current LHCb software. Therefore, the remainder of this lesson will cover a few of the common idioms in C++11 that a programmer experienced with the older C++ might not immediately think of.


## Types

Typing in C++11 is much simpler. If the type is deductible, auto allows you to avoid writing it out. A few examples of good uses of auto:

```cpp
// Avoiding double writing on pointers
auto pointer = new SomeNamespace::MyLongType(arg1, arg2);

// Does anyone know the type of an iterator? It's ugly!
auto iterator = some_vector.begin();

// This is useful for prototyping, but probably should be explictly typed in real code to help coders
auto type = function_returns_something();

// Worst use of auto; don't do this
auto a = 1;
```

ROOT macros have a syntax that precedes auto; you can simply assign (`x = Something();`) and if `x` does not already exist, it does the equivalent of `auto x = Something();`. This has the drawback that it is not valid C++ code, but unfortunately is still useful in a RootBook, where you may want to rerun a cell.

The `NULL` keyword, which is equivalent to 0, causes typing issues. A new `nullptr` keyword was added, and is not equivalent to zero. This is significantly better type-safety, and should be used instead of `NULL`.

## Iterators

While iterators existed in previous versions, using them is now part of the language, with the iterating for statement (for each). It allows a unintuitive iteration loop to be written more cleanly and compactly. Compare the following two methods of setting the values of a vector to zero:

```cpp
for(vector<double>::iterator iter = vector.begin(); iter != vector.end(); ++iter)
    *value = 0.0;

for(auto &value : vector)
    value = 0.0;
```

To make something iteratable, you should define a `begin` and `end` method or function. There are several options, as well. Adding an `&` will give you a reference, to save memory copies and to allow mutation of the original iterable. Adding `const &` avoids the copy but ensures that you don't change the original iterable.

A related improvement is the addition of container constructors. Which means you can *finally* do this:

```cpp
std::vector<int> values = {1,2,3,4,5,6};
```

C++ also has a variety of different initializers; C++11 added a uniform initializer syntax, so it has even more different initializers. The benefit is that it always works to initialize a value, while the other syntaxes can cause issues.

## Functional programming

Functions are now easier to refer to and create. A `std::function` type is useful, but usually will be hidden with `auto` unless you are crafting a function to take functions as arguments. The lambda function allows an inline function definition, with some perks. The syntax is `[](){}`, which looks like a normal function definition with the function name and type replaced by the square brackets. For example:

```cpp

auto square = [](double x){return x*x;};
double squared_five = square(5.0);
```

The lambda function gets interesting when you add something to the square brackets; this is called "capture" and allows you to capture the surrounding variables. For example:

```cpp
int i = 0;
auto counter = [&i](){return i++;};
counter(); // returns 0
counter(); // returns 1
```

You can capture by value, by reference, etc. If you use `[=]` or `[&]`, the lambda function will automatically capture (by value or reference, respectively) any variables mentioned inside the function. Note that if you do use capture, you will lose the ability to convert to a old-style C function pointer.


## Class improvements

Default values for members can be declared in the definition now (as I'm sure you've tried to do in older C++ at least once). You can also call a previous constructor in the initializer list (delegating constructors).


## Compile time improvements

The slow removal of the ugly, error-prone macro programming has started in C++11, with `constexpr`. A function or class with this modifier (and lots of restrictions as to what it can contain) can be used by the compiler at compile time to produce a result in your compiled code.

The move operation was added, as well. This allows moving a value through a special `std::move`, and also can be invoked by the compiler automatically if you return a value from a function. This reduces the need to return pointers from functions.

## Std library improvements

The powerful `std::shared_ptr` and `std::unique_ptr` remove most of the reasons to fear pointers, though they don't work that well with toolkits like ROOT that try to do their own memory management. A chrono library was added for consistent timekeeping on all platforms. A threading library provides tools that work with the new functional tools and makes threading easy, and also a mutex and atomic library. A regular expression library was added. More algorithms were added, and several
container libraries. A sized integer library was *finally* added with `stdint.h` (a benefit of being based on C99).

## Other features

Tuples allow multiple return values, albeit through `std::tie`. Variadic templates allow unlimited parameters to a function or constructor (like container constructors).
